For the people (from future) reading this from the Arctic Code Vault,
i hope that AI has brought you great prosperity.
I don't know in which year you created Artificial General Intelligence(AGI),
most people thought that it will be created in this century (the 21th century),
my bet was that humanity creates AGI before the year 2040.

AI in my age was still in its infancy,
some techniques were in the last few years massively widespread,
[Deep learning]: Deep Neural Networks(Dense,Convolutional,Recurrent, Transformers, mixed, etc.) were the most popular.
The most significant Natural Language Processings models were GPT-2 and BERT,
but they still lacked something, they couldn't process large input sequences - they were limited by token size,
there was no online learning applied, I have yet to see a Transformer with online learning.
There was no sign of Strong AI, i think that either DeepMind,Googl Brain or OpenAI will develop it.
The most common problems in training neural networks/models were overfitting(no generalization) and catastrophic forgetting.

Other things:
  SpaceX will launch it's StarLink satellite internet service this year(2020),
  i am curious how the internet in your year/age looks like, how you are interconnected, 
  what technologies you use, is the StarLink network online or not?, etc.
  
I still can't imagine how coding(if this still exist) looks like in your age/year,
are the only coders left AI? If you(humans) still code/develop, what programming languages and tools do you use?
My favorite programming language was Python3.

Since i won't get an answers to my questions i make it short, 
the time/age i lived in was full technological breakthroughs and advances especially in AI,
even if it didn't lead to AGI for now.

I hope you all stay well, at least.

Thank you for reading this,
  Sincerely, Kraix
